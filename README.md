# supercapacitor

supercapacitor generates [XSPF](http://www.xspf.org/) playlists for entire albums on demand.  The goal is to be able to point [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/) at a URL served by supercapacitor and have it play an entire album, given a collection of music files arranged in subdirectories by artist and album.

Its [namesake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercapacitor) also delivers excess pF.
